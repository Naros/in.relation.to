I'd like to thank the Atlanta JUG for hosting link:http://www.devnexus.com[DevNexus 2017] and the attendees
to both my and Edson Yanaga's presentations that covered ORM, Envers, OGM, and Search this year.

If you're interested in the ORM slide deck from the conference, I have published it link:http://bit.ly/2lhys7U[here].
